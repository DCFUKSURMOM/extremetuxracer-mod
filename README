MODS:

Added 320x240, 640x440, and 1920x1080 to the list of supported resolutions (src/winsys.cpp and src/winsys.h)

Changed some default settings, enabled the fps counter, and updated the stock config file to have info about
the new resolutions.(src/game_config.cpp)

Changed the hud font color to light blue to better fit the theme of the game (src/hud.cpp)

More may be done in the future, these are simple changes to a very simple game so maintaining it should be easy enough.
